# Overview
Ciphered is a project that encrypts/decrypts messages using codes or substitution ciphers with a friendly interface. Made for friends, to allow each other to post hidden messages on twitter, email, or chat rooms. It's meant to be a fun experience for people to learn about simple encryption methods that have been commonly used throughout history.
